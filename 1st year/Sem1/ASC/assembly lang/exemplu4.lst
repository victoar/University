     4                                  ;- the bits 7-10 of C are the same as the bits 1-4 of A
     5                                  ;- the bits 11-12 have the value 0

    10                                  ; and initialising all other bits to 0. The isolation operation can be performed

    13                                  ; The final word is obtained by applying the operator OR between all intermediate results obtained by using isolations and rotations.
